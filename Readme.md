# Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) :satellite:

## Abstract :book:

This dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), includes 5,863 X-Ray images, categorized into 2 categories: Pneumonia and Normal. The images are organized into two folders (train and test) and contain subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal).

## Dataset Information :globe_with_meridians:
<details>
  <summary> Dataset Structure </summary>

The dataset is organized into two main folders:

- Train: Contains training data for the model.
- Test: Contains test data for the model.

Each of these folders contains two subfolders:

- Pneumonia: Contains X-Ray images of lungs with Pneumonia.
- Normal: Contains X-Ray images of normal lungs.

## Goal :dart:
The goal of this project is to use these images to train a machine learning model to classify the X-Ray images into these two categories.
